# Introduction

Welcome to the iWorQ API! You can use our API to access iWorQ API endpoints, which can get information on various items in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, PHP, and Javascript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
```

```python
```

```shell
```

```javascript
```

```php
```

> Make sure to add your API key.

iWorQ uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

iWorQ expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: `
